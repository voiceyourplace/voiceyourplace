The town of Curtea de Argeș is so old and yet so new to me. My family moved here from somewhere else. I discovered the place growing up and it feels like it is waiting for new people.

I am pensive by nature, and I stress easily. Sometimes, even I don't understand myself and then I try to give my mind some space and go on a bike ride. While I`m pedaling, I like to watch passers-by and analyze their facial expressions. I wonder what do they think of our little town, where you always meet someone you know: a teacher, a classmate, the girls on the block trying to sell bracelets. But what about the monuments? Do the locals still appreciate them, or do they no longer even notice them?

As I ride, I get flashbacks of moments I’ve lived in this town: Curtea de Argeș Monastery is where I took my friend Connie from America, on a sightseeing tour. That's when I first realized that I`m proud of where I live. The Royal Church of St Nicholas is where I had one of my most meaningful conversations with a dear friend, discussing famous quotes by Oscar Wilde and sharing our dreams. I would like for the avenue going from St. Nicholas’ Church to the Monastery to become pedestrian one day a week (on Sundays) with perhaps one or two carriages giving rides.

The old buildings watch over us and sometimes I feel like they know all our secrets, even the embarrassing ones.
