Contrary to his name, Cristian is not religious, not at all. He doesn't believe in divine powers, saints painted on walls, or Sunday morning services. He has a realistic explanation for every religious theory. Nevertheless, his parents still drag him to church at Easter and Christmas. They don't accept their boy's way of thinking and often discuss how they might bring him back on the "right path". <br>
Today they are all visiting Curtea de Argeș. They decided to see the monastery because they heard a lot about it, but also because it represents the city in a way. Cristian was totally against it, but they told him he could stay in the park if he didn`t want to go inside. He likes the construction. It's beautiful and impressive. For a while, he sits on one of the more secluded benches and looks at the church without any thought. <br>
Suddenly something catches his eye. Not far from where he is sitting, in the shade of some pine trees, sits a girl with earphones on. She doesn't seem interested in anything, except perhaps the music, as she slowly moves her head to the beat. Sensing that she is being watched, she looks up. Their eyes meet. Time seems to vanish. <br>
The family comes out of the church. The girl takes off her earphones and walks away. <br>
Maybe Cristian will come back here again. <br>
