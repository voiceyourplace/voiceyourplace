— Your Highness, I have received urgent news that the Hungarians are planning to invade our lands, coming down from the land of Transylvania, because your lordship has refused to pay the 147,000 gold coins he owes as a vassal! <br>
— If what you say is true, may you be held in high honour. But if you betray me, I shall have you watered with the mare! <br>
— What I have heard, I have told thee, my lord! I am your loyal servant! <br>
— Then let the other soldiers know that we are preparing to attack in the valley of the river Olt! <br>
— Whoever dares to oppose us shall be reduced to crumbs, Your Highness!

My beloved wife,

Woe to the scoundrels who have dared trespass our land. None shall pass but dead soldiers.
If I don't return, it's no use looking for me. I'm fighting the Hungarian beasts. If you shan’t see me again, don't cry, but give alms to the village and let all the shepherds come. Let the children know that their father has given his all in battle and is leaving them the farms and fields.
I gave my word to his lordship King Basarab that I would die in battle, and I am loyal to him.
Be a loving mother, as you always have been, and God bless the boys.

Be a good wife too, <br>
Grigorie, boyar

I, Basarab, great voivode of Wallachia, son of Tihomir, above all voivodes and lords, ruler of people from the Carpathians to the Danube, have defeated at Posada, especially with the help of my people, the lawless Hungarian armies led by King Charles Robert of Anjou.
Thus, I declare myself, by the grace of God, my heavenly father, lord of the Romanian land above all voivodes, ban of Severin and landlord of Amlaș and Făgăraș counties.
May the good Lord bless you all.

Basarab
